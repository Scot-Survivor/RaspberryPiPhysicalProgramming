# Physical C/C++ Programming
# ==========================
# Introduction
While my primary background is in Python, I am starting to dabble in C/C++, other projects of mine demonstrate highly 
specialised or niche C/C++ skills. This is a collection of projects that I have built using C/C++. That aren't 
quite so niche. Using my Raspberry Pi 3B+, I use a Freenove Kit for the core physical components & in conjunction of their
ADC Library, tutorial PDFs, and the Freenove website, I develop the projects you see here. Due to my interest in AI as well,
I have a love for statistics because of this, a lot of my projects will also have the ability to generate graphs through the 
use of GNUPlot.
